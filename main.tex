	\section{Partionifolds}
		A partionifold on a manifold $M$ is a partition of $M$ into connected immersed submanifolds called leaves. \bigskip

		In the context of partionifolds we define the following map:
%
		\begin{align*}
			L_\bullet : M \to \mathcal{P}(M), \quad m \mapsto L_m
		\end{align*}

		where $L_m$ is the leaf containing the point $m$. \bigskip

		You can have curves with a non-vanishing derivative which switch between leaves. Let the partionifold be given by smooth hooks (to pick up spagetthi with, don't worry they won't fall off) and the lines $t \mapsto (t, c)$ for all $c \leq 0$. Then the curve which follows one hook to the edge and then continuous along the $x$-axis is non-vanishing and switches between leaves. \bigskip

		\subsection{Straightening lemma}
			Let $X \in \mathfrak{X}(M)$ be a non-vanishing vector field. Then there is a coordinate chart $\phi = (x_1, \ldots, x_n) : U \subseteq M \to V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ such that:
			%
			\begin{align*}
				X(m) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}(m) = d \phi_m^{-1}(e_1)
			\end{align*}

			\textbf{Proof:} \\
				We begin with an arbitrary coordinate chart $\psi = (y_1, \ldots, y_n) : U \to V$ of $M$ around $m_0 \in M$. In this chart we find that:
				%
				\begin{align*}
					X(m) = \sum_i \alpha_i(m) \frac{\partial}{\partial y_i}(m) = \sum_i \alpha_i(m) d \psi_m^{-1}(e_i) = d \psi_m^{-1}\left(\sum_i \alpha_i(m) e_i\right)
				\end{align*}

				where $\alpha_i : U \to \mathbb{R}$ are smooth functions. \bigskip

				Let:
				%
				\begin{align*}
					\tilde{\alpha}_i(v) := \alpha_i \circ \psi^{-1}(v)
				\end{align*}

				then:
				%
				\begin{align*}
					X(m) = d \psi_m^{-1}\left(\sum_i \tilde{\alpha}_i(v) e_i \right)
				\end{align*}

				where $v = \psi(m)$. \bigskip

				Now since the vector field $X$ is non-vanishing it must be the case that $\sum_i \tilde{\alpha}_i(v) e_i \neq 0$. Thus we can find a family of linear maps $T_v$ such that:
				%
				\begin{align*}
					T_v \left(\sum_i \tilde{\alpha}_i(v) e_i\right) = e_1
				\end{align*}

				which is smooth in $v$. That is:
				%
				\begin{align*}
					\tau_{ij}(v) := (T_v)_{ij}
				\end{align*}

				are smooth functions. \bigskip

				(This is essentially since moving $\sum \tilde{\alpha}_i e_i$ to $e_1$ is rotating and scaling depending on $v$) \bigskip

				Now we want to find $\rho : V \to V$ s.t.\ $d \rho_v = T_v$, which is equivalent to finding $\rho_i$:s satisfying:
				%
				\begin{align*}
					\nabla \rho_i = (\tau_{ij})_j
				\end{align*}

				This can be solved by integration:
				%
				\begin{gather*}
					\int_{0}^{v} \tau_{ij}(\gamma) \cdot d \gamma = \int_{0}^{v} \nabla \rho_i(\gamma) \cdot d \gamma = \int_0^T \sum_j \frac{\partial \rho_i(\gamma(t))}{\partial x_j} \frac{d \gamma_j}{dt}(t) \: dt \\
					= \int_0^T \frac{d(\rho_i \circ \gamma)}{dt}(t) \: dt = \rho_i(v) - \rho_i(0)
				\end{gather*}

				to which we can also impose that $\rho_i(0) = 0$ and get:
				%
				\begin{align*}
					\rho_i(v) = \int_{0}^{v} \tau_{ij}(\gamma) \cdot d \gamma
				\end{align*}

				Hence by defining:
				%
				\begin{align*}
					\phi = (x_1, \ldots, x_n) := \rho \circ \psi
				\end{align*}

				we get:
				%
				\begin{gather*}
					X(m) = d \psi_m^{-1} \circ T_v^{-1}(e_1) = d \psi_m^{-1} \circ \rho_{\psi(m)}^{-1}(e_1) = d(\rho \circ \psi)_m^{-1}(e_1) \\
					= d \phi^{-1}_m(e_1) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}(m)
				\end{gather*}

				which proves the statement.

		\subsection{Proposition 1.1.11}	
		Let $X$ be a given vector field in $\in \mathfrak{T}(L_\bullet)$, that is:
		%
		\begin{align*}
			X(m) \in T_m L_m
		\end{align*}

		for all $m \in M$. \bigskip

		Let $\gamma : I \to M$ be an integral curve of $X$:
		%
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{d \gamma}{dt}(t) = X(\gamma(t))
		\end{align*}

		which starts at $m_0 \in M$. \bigskip

		Since $X|_{L_{m_0}}$ is in fact a vector field of $L_{m_0}$ we can find also an integral curve $\lambda$ of $X|_{L_{m_0}}$ starting at $m_0$:
		%
		\begin{align*}
			\begin{cases}
				\frac{d \lambda}{dt}(t) = X|_{L_{m_0}}(\lambda(t)) = X(\lambda(t)) \\
				\lambda(0) = m_0 \\
				\text{im}(\lambda) \subseteq L_{m_0}
			\end{cases}
		\end{align*}

		In particular:
		%
		\begin{align*}
			\begin{cases}
				\frac{d \lambda}{dt}(t) = X(\lambda(t)) \\
				\lambda(0) = m_0
			\end{cases}
		\end{align*}

		which is satisfied also by $\gamma$:
		%
		\begin{align*}
			\begin{cases}
				\frac{d \gamma}{dt}(t) = X(\gamma(t)) \\
				\gamma(0) = m_0
			\end{cases}	
		\end{align*}

		Using the straightening lemma we can conclude that:
		%
		\begin{align*}
			\gamma(t) = \phi^{-1}(t e_1) = \lambda(t)
		\end{align*}

		for some coordinate chart $\phi$ satisfying $\phi(m_0) = 0$, and for $t \in (t_0 - \varepsilon, t_0 + \varepsilon)$ for some $\varepsilon > 0$. \bigskip

		Hence in particular:
		%
		\begin{align*}
			\text{im}(\gamma|_{(t_0 - \varepsilon, t_0 + \varepsilon)}) = \text{im}(\lambda|_{(t_0 - \varepsilon, t_0 + \varepsilon)}) \subseteq L_{m_0}
		\end{align*}

		i.e.\ $\gamma$ is locally contained in $L_{m_0}$ around $m_0$. \bigskip

		In fact this means that $\gamma^{-1}(L_{m})$ is open in $I$ for all $m$ since if $n \in \gamma^{-1}(L_{m})$ then $n = \gamma(t)$ for some $t$ and we can repeat the above argument to conclude that there is $\varepsilon > 0$ s.t.\ $(t - \varepsilon, t + \varepsilon) \subseteq \gamma^{-1}(L_m)$. \bigskip

		Now we can partition the interval $I$ as follows:
		%
		\begin{align*}
			I = \gamma^{-1}(M) = \gamma^{-1}\left(\bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} L_{m_\alpha}\right) = \bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} \gamma^{-1}(L_{m_\alpha})
		\end{align*}

		However this is a partition of $I$ into disjoint open sets, and $I$ is connected. Thus it must be the case that:
		%
		\begin{align*}
			I = \gamma^{-1}(L_{m_\alpha})
		\end{align*}

		for some $\alpha$. \bigskip

		In fact since $m_0 \in \text{im}(\gamma) \subseteq L_{m_\alpha}$ it must be the case that $L_{m_\alpha} = L_{m_0}$ and consequently that:
		%
		\begin{align*}
			\text{im}(\gamma) \subseteq L_{m_0}
		\end{align*}

		\begin{flalign*}&&\square\end{flalign*}

	\section{Proposition 1.1.12}
		Let $X \in \mathfrak{T}(L_\bullet)$. Fix some $t$ and assume that there is some $U \subseteq M$ s.t.\ the flow function $\phi_t^X$ is well-defined on $U$. This is an injective function since if $\phi_t^X(m) = \phi_t^X(n)$ then we can follow the flow in reverse and use the uniqueness of the flow to conclude that $m = n$. We also know from proposition 1.1.11 that $\phi_t^X(m) \in L_m$ for all $m \in M$. \bigskip

		Next we prove that $\phi_t^X$ is a diffeomorphism. In fact it suffices to prove that $\phi_t^X$ is a local diffeomorphism since it has already been proven to be injective. \bigskip

		We begin by observing that for each $s \in [0, t]$ we can find a coordinate chart $(x_s : U_s \to V_s)$ around $\phi_s^X(m)$. Since the image of the integral curve:
		%
		\begin{align*}
			s \mapsto \phi_s^X(m) \qquad (s \in [0, t])
		\end{align*}

		is compact we can pass to a finite number of coordinate charts $(x_i : U_i \to V_i)$ around $\phi_{s_i}^X(m)$ for $i \in [0, N]$ s.t.\ $s_0 = 0$, $s_N = t$ and $\{U_i\}_i$ covers the image of the integral curve. \bigskip

		We can then find balls:
		%
		\begin{align*}
			B_{\varepsilon_i}[x_i(\phi_{r_i}^X(m))] \subseteq x_i(U_i \cap U_{i + 1}) \qquad i \in \{0, \ldots, N - 1\}
		\end{align*}

		Let:
		%
		\begin{align*}
			\varepsilon := \min_i(\varepsilon_i)
		\end{align*}

		Then:
		%
		\begin{align*}
			B_i := B_\varepsilon[x_i(\phi_{r_i}^X(m))] \subseteq x_i(U_i \cap U_{i + 1}) \qquad i \in \{0, \ldots, N - 1\}
		\end{align*}

		By defining $r_N := t$ and:
		%
		\begin{align*}
			U'_i := x_i^{-1}(B_i) \qquad i \in \{0, \ldots, N - 1\}
		\end{align*}

		and $U' := x_0^{-1}(B_\varepsilon(0))$ we may observe that see that $\phi_t^X|_{U'}$ splits as:
		%
		\begin{align*}
			\phi_t^X|_{U'} = \phi_{r_N - r_{N - 1}}^X \circ \ldots \circ \phi_{r_1 - r_0}^X \circ \phi_{r_0}^X|_{U'} = \phi_{r_N - r_{N - 1}}^X \circ \ldots \circ \phi_{r_1 - r_0}^X|_{U_0} \circ \phi_{r_0}^X|_{U'}
		\end{align*}

		As such we consider some coordinate chart $(x : U' \to V')$ around $m \in U$. Then let $U''$ be an open subset of $U'$ containing $m$ which is s.t.\ there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ s.t.\ $\frac{t}{N}e_1 + v \in V'$ for all $v \in V'' := x(U'')$. This can be utilized due to the fact that $\phi_t^X$ can be split as follows: 
		%
		\begin{align*}
			\phi_t^X = \underbrace{\phi_{t/N}^X \circ \ldots \circ \phi_{t/N}^X}_{\text{$N$ times}}
		\end{align*}

		Then

\section{Notations and definitions}

	In this section we recall some of the basic definitions of differential geometry and introduce the notation we're gonna use in the rest of the report, especially about tangent spaces vector fields.

	\todo{preliminary notations}

	Now we recall one of the definitions of a tangent vector.

	\begin{definition}
		Let $m \in M$.
		We call \textbf{tangent space of $M$ at the point $m$} (written $\T_m{M}$) the set of ``\emph{directional derivatives}'', or rather ``\emph{path derivatives}'' (the direction is described by a smooth path in $M$). \\
		Meaning that any \textbf{tangent vector} $v \in \T_m{M}$ is a function $v: \Cinf(M) \to \R$ defined by
		$$
			\forall f \in \Cinf(M), \quad v(f) = \frac{\d}{\di{t}} f(\gamma(t)) \Big|_{t=0}
		$$
		for a path $\gamma \in \Cinf(\R, M)$ such that $\gamma(0) = m$.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{notation}
		Let $\gamma \in \Cinf(J, M)$ (where $J \subset \R$ is an open subset, often taken to be an interval), and $t_0 \in J$.
		As a shorthand for the path derivative along $\gamma$ at time $t_0$ of a function $f \in \Cinf(M)$ we write 
		$$
			\frac{\partial f}{\partial \gamma}(t_0) := \frac{\d}{\di{t}} f(\gamma(t)) \Big|_{t=t_0}
		$$

		Meaning that for any $m \in M$ a tangent vector $v \in \T_m{M}$ is of the form
		$$
			v = \frac{\partial \bullet}{\partial \gamma}(0)
		$$
		for a path $\gamma \in \Cinf(\R, M)$ such that $\gamma(0) = m$.
	\end{notation}

\section{Random notes}

	A smooth curve $\gamma: \R \to M$ with a derivative vanishing for some $t$ at some point can then switch between any leaves that have the point $m = \gamma(t)$ in their adherence

	Questions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item can a curve with a non-vanishing derivative switch between leaves ? Yes
		\item why are we interested in those curves?
		\item what about a derivative vanishing on some interval? Not interesting: the path just stops in this time period, so we only get one possible branching point anyway.
		\item what if you don't have a whole partition?
	\end{itemize}


	\subsection{Tangent space and vector fields}

		To (maybe) put in there:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item tangent vector: path derivative, local/coordinate version, (equivalence class of paths)
			\item tangent map: $\phi: M \to N$, $\T{\phi}: \T{M} \to \T{N}$
			\item tangent bundle: charts are $\big( \T(U_\alpha), \T(\phi_\alpha) \big)$ for the atlas $\big\{ (U_\alpha, \phi_\alpha) \big\}_\alpha$ of $M$
			\item vector field: smooth map $X: M \to \T{M}$, local version as directional derivations, action on $\Cinf(M)$ ($X: M \times \Cinf(M) \to \R$, so we can also see it as $X: \Cinf(M) \to \Cinf(M)$ \todo{take a look at the smoothness involved in the manipulation (oh, it probably need $\Cinf$ and not just ``differentiable'' for the image to still be differentiable)})
			\item integral curve
			\item Lie bracket
		\end{itemize}

		For any $m \in M$ the tangent space $\T_m{M}$ is the set of ``directional derivatives'' (the direction is given by a path in $m$).
		Meaning that any $v \in \T_m{M}$ is a function $v: \Cinf(M) \to \R$ defined by
		$$
			\forall f \in \Cinf(M), \quad v(f) = \frac{\d}{\di{t}} f(\gamma(t)) \Big|_{t=0}
		$$
		for a path $\gamma \in \Cinf(\R, M)$ such that $\gamma(0) = m$.

		\todo{A word about equivalence classes of paths?}

		\todo{Let's introduce the notation $\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{\gamma}}(m) := v(f)$}

		If we fix a coordinate chart $(U, x)$ around $m$ then the direction can be explicitely expressed as a vector in $\R^n$.

		For every $t \in \gamma^{-1}(U) \subset \R$ we have
		$$
			f(\gamma(t)) = \big( (f \circ x^{-1}) \circ (x \circ \gamma) \big)(t)
		$$
		where:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $(x \circ \gamma) \in \Cinf(\R, \R^n)$
			\item $(f \circ x^{-1}) \in \Cinf(\R^n, \R)$
		\end{itemize}
		By the chain rule we then have
		$$
			v(f) = \underbrace{\di[x(m)] \big( f \circ x^{-1} \big)}_{\R^n \to \R} \bigg[ \underbrace{\frac{\d}{\di{t}} \big( x \circ \gamma \big)(t) \Big|_{t=0}}_{\in \R^n} \bigg]
		$$

		If we write
		$$
			\frac{\d}{\di{t}} \big( x \circ \gamma \big)(t) \Big|_{t=0} = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i e_i \in \R^n
		$$
		for some $(a_i)_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ we have
		$$
			v(f) = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \di[x(m)](f \circ x^{-1})[e_i]
		$$

		We introduce the notations $\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x_i}}: U \to \R$ for directional derivative using the coordinate chart $x$ on $U$. We write
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x_i}}(m) &= \frac{\partial{(f \circ x^{-1})}}{\partial{e_i}}(x(m)) \\
			                                     &= \di[x(m)](f \circ x^{-1})[e_i] \\
			                                     &= \frac{\d}{\di{t}} \big( f \circ x^{-1} \big)(x(m) + t e_i) \Big|_{t=0} \\
			                                     &= \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\big( f \circ x^{-1} \big)(x(m) + t e_i) - f(m)}{t}
		\end{align*}
		\todo{clarify/choose notations}

		$$
			\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x_i}}(m) \quad \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x_i}}\Big|_m \quad \frac{\partial}{\partial{x_i}} f \Big|_m \quad \frac{\partial}{\partial{x_i}} \Big|_m f
		$$

		So we can rewrite:
		$$
			v(f) = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial{x_i}}(m)
		$$

		We can also write $v$ like this:
		$$
			v = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \frac{\partial \,\bullet\,}{\partial{x_i}}(m)
		$$

		Let $\phi = (\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_n): x(U) \to \phi(x(U))$ any diffeomorphism.\\
		We can consider the chart $(U, y)$ where $y = \phi \circ x$.
		% So $(y_1, \ldots, y_n) = (\phi_1 \circ x, \ldots, \phi_n \circ x)$.

		Using this chart we have
		\begin{align*}
			v(f) &= \di[y(m)] \big( f \circ y^{-1} \big) \bigg[ \frac{\d}{\di{t}} \big( y \circ \gamma \big)(t) \Big|_{t=0} \bigg] \\
			     &= \di[\phi(x(m))] \big( f \circ x^{-1} \circ \phi^{-1} \big) \bigg[ \frac{\d}{\di{t}} \big( \phi \circ x \circ \gamma \big)(t) \Big|_{t=0} \bigg]
		\end{align*}

		So in order to have $v = \frac{\partial{\bullet}}{\partial{y_1}}$ we want
		$$
			\frac{\d}{\di{t}} \big( \phi \circ x \circ \gamma \big)(t) \Big|_{t=0} = e_1
		$$

		Using the chain rule we have
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{\d}{\di{t}} \big( \phi \circ x \circ \gamma \big)(t) \Big|_{t=0} &= \di[x(m)]{\phi} \Big[ {\textstyle\sum_{i=1}^n a_i e_i} \Big] \\
			                                                                       &= \frac{\d}{\di{t}} \phi\big( x(m) + {\textstyle t \sum_{i=1}^n a_i e_i} \big) \Big|_{t=0}
		\end{align*}

		Let's now consider a vector field $X \in \X(M)$ and $X|_U$ its restriction to $U$.

		For any point $p \in U$, we have a family $(a_i(p))_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ such that
		$$
			X(p) = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i(p) \frac{\partial \,\bullet\,}{\partial{x_i}}(p)
		$$

		The goal will be to find a

	I find the notation strange in the sense that we impose $\gamma_m(0) = m$ and take the path derivative at $t=0$. So I feel it should rather be one of the two following:
