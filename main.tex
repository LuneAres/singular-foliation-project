	\section{Partionifolds}
		A partionifold on a manifold $M$ is a partition of $M$ into connected immersed submanifolds called leaves. \bigskip

		In the context of partionifolds we define the following map:
%
		\begin{align*}
			L_\bullet : M \to \mathcal{P}(M), \quad m \mapsto L_m
		\end{align*}

		where $L_m$ is the leaf containing the point $m$. \bigskip

		You can have non-vanishing curves which switch between leaves. Let the partionifold be given by smooth hooks (to pick up spagetthi with, don't worry they won't fall off) and the lines $t \mapsto (t, c)$ for all $c \leq 0$. Then the curve which follows one hook to the edge and then continuous along the $x$-axis is non-vanishing and switches between leaves.
